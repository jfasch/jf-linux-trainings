Training Records, By Date
=========================

Each training is different:

* *The exercises* that I have in the PDF slides are mostly solved in
  similar ways in each of the trainings, with only minor variations.
* *The questions* show that humans are different. To answer those, I
  frequently hack something together in a short program. If the answer
  fits in a `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__, I write the
  code there and make inline notes.
* *The group projects* are launched when all is said and hacking is
  desired. This is often the case when the audience is homogeneous
  (e.g. all from the same company where they work together), and the
  topic is drawn from their own problem domains.
* Even if all else is the same, *my mood* has enough entropy to create
  variations.

The content of this directory makes all this available to the audience
after the training, and gives the not-yet-audience a feeling what they
are maybe up to.

  Kerschhaggl GmbH <https://www.evk.biz>`__, I'd have to pay for what
  I've learned from you.
